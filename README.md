Memory Puzzle Game
A simple Memory Puzzle Game where players must match pairs of cards within a time limit. The game uses Python's tkinter library for the graphical interface.

Features
4x4 Card Grid: The game board consists of 16 cards, shuffled into 8 pairs.
Time Limit: Players must match all pairs within 60 seconds.
Card Matching: Players reveal two cards at a time to find matching pairs. Correct matches stay revealed, while incorrect pairs are hidden again.
End of Game: If the player finds all pairs before the time runs out, they win. If the timer reaches zero, they lose.
Prerequisites
To run the game, ensure you have the following:

Python 3.x installed
tkinter library (usually comes pre-installed with Python)
For some Linux distributions, you might need to install tkinter separately:
bash
Copy code
sudo apt-get install python3-tk
How to Run
Clone or download the game script to your local machine.
Open a terminal (or command prompt) and navigate to the folder containing the script.
Run the script using Python:

python memory_puzzle.py
Game Instructions
The game starts with a 4x4 grid of face-down cards.
Click on two cards to reveal their values.
If the two revealed cards match, they remain revealed. If they don’t match, they will be hidden again after a brief pause.
The goal is to find all matching pairs before the timer (60 seconds) runs out.
The game ends when all pairs are matched, or the timer reaches zero.
Game Logic
Shuffled Cards: The game randomly shuffles 8 pairs of cards each time a new game starts.
Timer: The player has 60 seconds to complete the game. A countdown timer is displayed in the window title bar.
End Conditions: The game ends in two ways:
If all pairs are matched, the player wins, and a congratulatory message is shown.
If the timer runs out before all pairs are matched, the game ends with a losing message.

Future Improvements
Levels of Difficulty: Add support for different grid sizes (e.g., 3x3 for easy, 5x5 for hard).
Themes: Add different themes for the card values (e.g., numbers, images, etc.).
Leaderboard: Add a high score or leaderboard system to track the fastest players.
